NITT-Connect
============

Python, and django django DJANGOOOOooooo!!!!

I am persuing  masters in Computer applications at NIT Trichy, India. And one thing that I have come across is that a lot 
of conversations, circulars and notices are posted on Facebook groups, I personally don't like the idea of using Facebook..
(I am more of a Tumblr(www.tumblr.com) guy)  for such stuff. 

So, why not we create something nice and cool enough that would eliminate our need to use facebook? The Answer is, this
project. This project(NITT connect) has been developed to cater the need of students to connect with each other and to connect
with their teachers as well. 

The design of this project is focused around the need of the people of NITT and what are the trends that are usually 
prevailing in our campus which students can discuss and share there ideas.
